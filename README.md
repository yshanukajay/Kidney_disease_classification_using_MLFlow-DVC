## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the automated classification of kidney diseases (such as Tumors, Stones, Cysts, or Normal) using Deep Learning. By leveraging **MLflow** and **DVC**, the project ensures full reproducibility, experiment tracking, and efficient data management.

### Key Features
* **Deep Learning Framework:** Built using TensorFlow/Keras for high-accuracy image classification.
* **Data Versioning (DVC):** Tracks large datasets and model weights without bloating the Git repository.
* **Experiment Tracking (MLflow):** Logs parameters, metrics (Accuracy, Loss), and model artifacts for every run.
* **Modular Pipeline:** Clear separation of data ingestion, preprocessing, training, and evaluation for production readiness.
